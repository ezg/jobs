*The DARPA Data Driven Discovery of Models (D3M) program automates the methods in data science to create empirical models of real, complex processes. D3M enables non-expert users to make predictions from data without the need for data scientists. The program accelerates scientific discovery and intelligence analysis by automatically searching the complex model space and discovering and explaining models to users.*

# Welcome!
