Data is a big part of modern life. It is essential to our work, our society and economy, the media we consume, and the apps we use to track the way we exercise, eat, and sleep.

Capitalizing on this data and understanding it are such important skills that we believe everyone should have. However, not everyone has a PhD in Machine Learning or is a Python / Keras / Pandas / SciKit wizard. Our goal is to empower everyone to make their data useful by making data science more accessible. 

This mission has followed us many years and has started out as a research project at MIT and Brown University. Now at einblick analytics, we are commercializing this research and are building a data science platform where everyone can effortlessly, almost playfully, interact with and model their data.
