**Goal:** *Understand Northstar's canvas main components*              

Now that we are in the crops dataset workspace, we need to get familiar with its main components and how to interact with them. <em>Northstar's</em> workspaces are interactive canvases on which you can perform<em> data exploration</em> and <em>inference</em> intuitively. Any object that you are going to place on a canvas can be moved, resized and deleted. You can also navigate in the canvas by clicking on an empty spot and dragging the canvas in the direction you prefer. In the canvas' top left section, you will find a menu that you can use to explore and select attributes from the dataset or select an algorithmic operator.
