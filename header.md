Einblick Analytics, an MIT and Brown University spin-off,  aims to enable everyone to make an impact through data not opinions. Our belief is that those who understand data the fastest, win. This requires to empower more people to make use of their data and tremendously reduce the time to insight/model. 

Our technology to achieve this goal has been developed over the last five years at MIT and Brown University and won several prizes, including DARPAâ€™s D3M Automated Machine Learning competitions. Now at einblick analytics, we are commercializing this research and are building a data science platform with the most innovative user interface and backend.

This mission has followed us many years and has started out as a research project at MIT and Brown University. Now at einblick analytics, we are commercializing this research and are building a data science platform where everyone can effortlessly, almost playfully, interact with and model their data.
